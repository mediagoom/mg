### Linux

The *linux* download should work on most distributions as long as they are 64 bit.
In case it should not work you can either [build](https://github.com/mediagoom/mg/wiki/Build) it yourself or use docker.

After download make sure to run `chmod +x mg`

### Window

Window executable are inside the zip file.
If you do not whether your windows is 32 or 64 bit download the x86 witch should work in both win 32 bit as well as win 64 bit.

### Docker

You can use Docker to run mg. The docker image is [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/mediagoom/nginx-play).
